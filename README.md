# Where people stay - extracting destinations from GPS data

This project contains a fast Python implementation of algorithms
proposed in [[1]](#hariharan2004) to extract so-called stop locations
from GPS data. The project also contains some sample data and a
detailed Jupyter notebook that showcases the work.
